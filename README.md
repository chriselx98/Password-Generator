# Password Generator

##Brief Description

This project was made to learn about javascript and what we can use it for. I tried to create a password generator that prompts users with a few options for their random password.
The user goes through 5 prompts and if a user does not pick one type of character then a window alert shows up to tell the user that they must pick at least one type of chracter.

They will be brought back to the main page and they can click generate password to start the process once again.

This project is not done yet and still needs to provide a random password to the user.
